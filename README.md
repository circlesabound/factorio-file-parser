# factorio-mod-settings-parser

Rust library to parse the `mod-settings.dat` file format used in the game Factorio.

The logic in this library is taken from the information provided in the [Factorio wiki](https://wiki.factorio.com/Mod_settings_file_format), with inspiration from the sample code provided by Factorio dev Rseding91 on the [forums](https://forums.factorio.com/59851).
